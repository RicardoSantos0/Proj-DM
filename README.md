This is an ongoing process effort by:

The goal is to perform donor segmentation of PVA dataset in the hope of developing targeted marketing strategies to incentivize lapsed donors to keep contributing to the non-profit association.

We tried 3 different clustering approaches and chose Self organizing maps as the best method for our approach.

Each Notebook contains a portion of the project:

1.	DATA_CLEAN_EXPLOR
2.	KMEANS_HC
3.	GAUSSIAN_MIXTURE
4.	SOM_HC
5.	CLUSTER_CHARACTERIZATION
